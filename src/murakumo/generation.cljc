(ns murakumo.generation
  "Pure contract for murakumo.cloud's public generation API — request bodies,
  the ranges the fleet actually accepts, response parsing, and the retry
  classification. No HTTP, no clock, no filesystem; murakumo.generation.client
  is the IO side.

  Every constraint here was measured against the live service on 2026-07-29,
  not read off a spec. Written from the documented shape alone, a caller fails
  on first contact in four separate ways, and each one costs a round trip to
  discover:

    1. Wrong host. `api.murakumo.cloud` 401s a generation-scope token; the
       gate that accepts it is `generation.murakumo.cloud`. They are different
       Workers with different signing secrets, so the hostnames are not
       interchangeable.
    2. The API advertises artifact and status URLs on `murakumo.cloud`
       regardless of which host accepted the job — following them verbatim
       401s on every fetch. See rebase-host.
    3. Geometry and frame counts are constrained (multiples of 32; 8n+1), and
       a vertical short's own 720 is a 400. See snap-dimension / snap-frames.
    4. `params.locale` wants BCP-47: \"ja\" and \"ja_JP\" are both rejected.

  Model ids are deliberately NOT pinned by default: an omitted `model` lets
  murakumo resolve the function's own `:default` from murakumo.edn, so a
  fleet-side model swap reaches every consumer without a release here
  (the murakumo-main rule, ADR-2607173100, applied to generation)."
