  "The submit → poll → fetch → verify loop for murakumo.cloud generation,
  with the transport injected.

  Every trap this integration has lives in one place: which host to talk to,
  rebasing the advertised artifact URL, verifying the declared digest,
  retrying a cold fleet instead of degrading, and the poll schedule. Those are
  what cost round trips to discover (see murakumo.generation), and they are
  identical whether the caller is a JVM production executor or an nbb operator
  script — so they are here, and only the four host primitives differ.

  Consumers pass:
    :request!    (fn [method url body-or-nil token] -> {:status int :body map})
                 -- body is a Clojure map; the impl encodes/decodes JSON.
                    Any transport failure should come back as {:status 0}.
    :download!   (fn [url out token] -> truthy on success)
    :sha256-hex  (fn [path] -> lowercase hex of the file's bytes)
    :sleep!      (fn [ms] -> nil)   -- may be a no-op in an async host
    :delete!     (fn [path] -> nil) -- discard a corrupt download (optional)

  Nothing here throws at the caller: an unreachable fleet, a missing token, a
  failed job, a digest mismatch all return nil after saying which on stderr,
  so a scheduled producer degrades to its own fallback instead of losing the
  night's work. What it will NOT do is degrade quietly — every nil is warned
  with the reason, because a fallback that reads as success is how a pipeline
  ships placeholders for two weeks without anyone noticing."
